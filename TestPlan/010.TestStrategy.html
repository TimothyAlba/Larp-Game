Team LARP will be using JUnit to test the Model and Controler portion of the MVC system architecture and user testing for the View portion. The style of testing
will be white box. White box testing says that you can look at the code and examine all parts to make your decisions
on what to test.

<h3>Unit Testsing</h3>

The unit testing will involve testing the individual classes and methods to ensure they don't crash and return what they are
supposed to.
