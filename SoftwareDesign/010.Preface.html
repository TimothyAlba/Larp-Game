<p>
This software design document will outline the components for our Less Aggravating Role Play game 
The game will look similar to most 2d RPG's. This software will feature many GUI components that
will allow the user to move around in a world where they will interact with chest's and fight enemy's.
</p>


<p>
The design will feature java classes that when put together will create our
a fully functional game. The GUI components will make the game much more user 
friendly and make the game feel more immersive.
