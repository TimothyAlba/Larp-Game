	As the client I accept the design of the game presented in this document. The battle sequence diagram meets my requirements by describing in detail the process in which a Player's attack and an enemy's counter attack will play out. The user interface looks more developed and intuitive than in the SRS and will allow the player to see their knight's health and equipped weapon(s) while strolling through the dungeon. Finally the object classes representing the game covers the core requirements for a complete game state that can be easily extended after release.
