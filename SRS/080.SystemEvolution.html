<p>
The system will first release as a piece of software that will allow the player to at the very least move within the room, interact with doors, and run into encounters. After completing the initial release there will be focus on adding combat encounters, inventory and items, and chests. The final release will require focus on tweaking combat encounters to be challenging yet make the dungeon possible to complete, adding the boss, and incorporating any extended features if time allows.
