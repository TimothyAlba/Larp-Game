<p>LARP's software will be successful if it meets the minimum requirements listed in this SRS. The game should provide the user with a character to move and a world to move about in. The world will feature multiple scenes with the possibility of initiating a battle event or picking up a chest. The battle event will be on a turn by turn basis and the winner is the last one with any health points left. The chest will be either more health points for the user or a different weapon. The game will also feature more than one level of difficulty. If these minimum requirements are met, the game will be easily extensible with different features and graphical enhancements.</p>
