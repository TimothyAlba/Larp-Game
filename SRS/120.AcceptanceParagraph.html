<h2 id="AcceptanceParagraph">Acceptance Paragraph</h2>
<p>I, the 'Client', accept this SRS document describing the LARP software. The game will provide the user with a character to move and a world to move about in. The world will feature multiple scenes with the possibility of initiating a battle event or finding a chest. The battle event will be on a turn by turn basis and the winner is the last one with any health points left. If these minimum requirements are met, the game will be easily extensible with different features and graphical enhancements. </p>
